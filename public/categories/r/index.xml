      <description>This is a blog that I will use to share my study notes and life.
My name is Tianyu Zeng (曾天昱) or I can go by Frank. I was born in Shanghai, China and currently a senior student of University of Wisconsin - Madion, majoring in computer science and statistics.
I have a strong intest in statistics/machine learning and back-end software development. Thus, I would like to share some thoughts and knowledge that I learned from the class and books.</description>

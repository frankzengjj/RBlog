<p>This is a blog that I will use to share my study notes and life.</p>
<p>My name is Tianyu Zeng (曾天昱) or I can go by Frank. I was born in Shanghai, China and currently a senior student of University of Wisconsin - Madion, majoring in computer science and statistics.</p>
<p>I have a strong intest in statistics/machine learning and back-end software development. Thus, I would like to share some thoughts and knowledge that I learned from the class and books. So I wil include some theories as well as coding regarding my favorite topics.</p>
